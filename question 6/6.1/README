# Palindrome or Reverse Function README

## Description

The `check_palindrome_or_reverse()` function is a Python script that checks whether a given word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

If the word is a palindrome, the function will print "Yes, it is a palindrome." Otherwise, it will print "No, it is not a palindrome." along with the reversed version of the word.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x must be installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Running the Function

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the `check_palindrome_or_reverse()` function is located.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

python palindrom.py

4. The function will prompt you to enter a word. Type the word and press Enter.

5. The function will then determine whether the word is a palindrome or not and display the result accordingly.

## Example

The function will prompt you to enter a word. For example, you enter "radar" and press Enter.

The function will then display the following output:

In this case, "radar" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.
