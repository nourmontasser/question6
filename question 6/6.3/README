##Function Description

The myDigitalClock function takes no input parameters and is designed to be a standalone clock that continuously displays the current time.

Function Logic
The function retrieves the current time using the Date object in JavaScript.
It extracts the hours, minutes, and seconds from the current time.
If the hour is greater than 12, it converts the hour to the 12-hour format and sets the zone to "PM."
If the hour is exactly 12, it keeps the hour as is and sets the zone to "PM."
If the hour is less than 10, it adds a leading zero to the hour to ensure a two-digit format.
If the minutes or seconds are less than 10, it adds a leading zero to each to ensure a two-digit format.
The function creates a time string in the format "hh:mm:ss AM/PM" and logs it to the console.
The function sets a timeout of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to call itself again after each second, ensuring the clock updates continuously.
